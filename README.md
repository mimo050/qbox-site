# QBox — Landing Page

A lightweight, responsive landing page inspired by gbox.run.

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new public repo named `qbox-site`.
2. Upload these files to the repo root.
3. In repo Settings → Pages → Set Source to `main` → `/ (root)`.
4. Wait 1–2 minutes, then open: `https://<your-username>.github.io/qbox-site/`

## Customize Links
Edit `index.html` to replace all `href="#"` placeholders with your real links:
- Download .ipa
- Customizer
- Signer
- TrollStore import/installer
- Telegram / Discord
- Certificate tools

## Notes
- Includes dark/light theme toggle.
- Includes EN/AR toggle (client-side).
